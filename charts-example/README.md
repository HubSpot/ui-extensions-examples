### Description:

This card contains:

1. Line chart that shows the customer's purchase history over time, showing the total revenue generated from their purchases of outdoor gear and apparel products. In this example, we show how to format the data.

2. Stacked bar chart shows the distribution of sales revenue by product category for the customer over a specific time period. This can help the sales rep understand which product categories are performing well and where there may be opportunities to upsell or cross-sell additional products. This is an example with pre-formatted data.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Update your CLI and & authenticate your developer account

1. Update to latest CLI version by running `npm install -g @hubspot/cli@latest`.
2. Run `hs init` if you haven’t already done so to create a config file for your parent account.
3. Run `hs auth` to authenticate your developer account. Alternatively, select your pre-authenticated account with `hs accounts use`.

### Step 2: Create and upload Charts example project

Follow app specific instructions:

- [Public app](./public/README.md)
- [Private app](./private/README.md)

### Step 3: View the cards in the dev test account

In the main menu of your dev test account, select `Contacts` > `Contacts` to view contact records. Click on any of the contact objects and navigate to the custom tab to access the sample card. If you don’t have any contacts in the account you’re using to view this sample, create a contact by the following steps:

1. In the main menu, select `Contacts` > `Contacts`.
2. Click `Create contact` in the top right hand corner and fill in all required fields. Click `create` once you’ve finished filling in your contact details.
3. Your new contact should appear in the `Contacts table`. Select it and navigate to the `Custom` tab in the middle pane to access the sample card.

If you haven't customized the tabs before follow step #4 from [this guide](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/platform/ui-extensions-quickstart).
