# Deals summary sample

This tutorial will help you get up to speed with React based UI extensions in the HubSpot CRM. You’ll install a project containing a CRM card with two components. Then you’ll follow the steps to add one more component to the card.

We recommend installing this sample in a Sandbox account.

## Update your CLI and & authenticate your account

[Full local environment documentation](https://app.hubspot.com/l/docs/doc/platform/developer-projects-setup#set-up-your-local-environment)

1. Update to latest CLI version by running `npm install -g @hubspot/cli@latest`.
2. Run `hs init` if you haven’t already done so to create a config file for your parent account.
3. Run `hs auth` to authenticate your account. Alternatively, select your pre-authenticated account with `hs accounts use`.

## Clone the project and upload it to your HubSpot sandbox account

- Run the command `hs project upload` to upload this sample project to your HubSpot account
- In the main menu of your HubSpot account navigate to `Contacts` > `Contacts`. Click into the `Brian Halligan` contact.
- Select the `Custom tab` in the middle pane of this contact record
- You should see the Deals summary card with two components: Deals and Unit Price. These will both be set to 0 because there are currently no deals associated with this contact.

## Create two deal records

- In the main menu, navigate to `Sales` > `Deals`.
- Click `Create deal` in the top right hand corner.
- Give your dummy deal a name, an amount, and set the deal association to the `Brian Halligan` contact.
- Repeat the last two steps to create a second deal.
- In the main menu of your HubSpot account navigate to `Contacts` > `Contacts`. Click into the `Brian Halligan` contact. Now you should see 2 deals listed in the `Deals summary` card and the sum total of the amounts you entered for each deal. Next you’ll add an `Average Margin` component.

## Setup local dev

- Run npm install to install dependencies for this project.
- Create a file named `.env` inside the app.functions folder (inside `src/app`)
- In your HubSpot account, click on the CRM development item in the main navigation
- In the sidebar under Tools select Private apps and find the Deals summary app. Click View access token and copy this token to your clipboard.
- Add it to your `.env` file

- To begin the dev process and automatically see your changes reflected in the CRM, run hs project dev.
- Return to the contact record and refresh the browser. You should now see a developing locally icon next to the card title.

## Add the Average Margin component

- Open the [get-data.js](./src/app/app.functions/get-data.js) file in your local text editor. This file is using the [HubSpot API client](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/overview) to fetch deal data related to whichever contact record an end user is viewing in the CRM. This fetching is being done by the `getAssociatedDeals` function. The result of this function is stored in a deals variable. The `calculateTotalAmounts` function is using this data to calculate the total amount of deals.
- To begin the dev process and automatically see your changes reflected in the CRM, run `hs project dev`.
- Add a function called `calculateAverageAmount` below the `calculateTotalAmounts` function. It should look like this:

```javascript
function calculateAverageAmount(deals) {
  const totalCount = deals.length;

  const amounts = deals.map((deal) => parseFloat(deal.properties.amount));
  const totalDeals = amounts.reduce((sum, amount) => sum + amount, 0);

  const average = Math.ceil(totalDeals / totalCount);
  return -Math.round(-average);
}
```

- Next add a variable in the exports statement at the top of the file to store the result of this function and add this variable to the send response.

```javascript
const avgAmount = calculateAverageAmount(deals);
sendResponse({ deals, totalAmount, avgAmount });
```

- This is everything required for fetching the data and making it available to the front end. Open the [DealsSummary.jsx](./src/app/extensions/DealsSummary.jsx) file to add this data to the CRM card.
- First, add a state variable to define the initial state of the average amount

```javascript
const [avgAmount, setAvgAmount] = useState(0);
```

- Next, update the state within the `useEffect` function

```javascript
setAvgAmount(serverlessResponse.response.avgAmount);
```

- Finally, add a new `StatisticsItem` component to display the average amount in the CRM card

```jsx
<StatisticsItem label="Avg margin" number={avgAmount}>
  <Text>Low End</Text>
</StatisticsItem>
```

- To quit the dev process and upload your finished work, press `q` in the CLI. This will stop the local dev server.
- Run `hs project upload` to upload the current state of your local project to your HubSpot account.
