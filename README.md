# Examples of HubSpot UI Extensions

This is a collection of HubSpot developer projects with custom CRM cards. Each folder holds a working developer project, including a README with a description on what that example CRM card demonstrates and instructions on how to get the card working in your own HubSpot account.

Access to these custom CRM cards is part of an ongoing beta, and more examples will be added over time.
