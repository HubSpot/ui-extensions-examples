# success-and-error-banners

This example project demonstrates how to display success and error banners as feedback to a user action, like clicking a button. These can be helpful when communicating whether a given request, especially to a third-party API, has succeeded or failed.

For the purposes of this example, the GET request randomly succeeds or fails each time the button is clicked.
