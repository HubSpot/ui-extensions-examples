# Contact Duplicate Extension

The Contact Duplicate extension allows a HubSpot user to duplicate one of their contacts, its deal & company associations, and some of its contact properties.

This extension demonstrates a number of interactions that are enabled by React extensions.

- async fetching with HubSpot serverless functions
- loading and error states
- GraphQL calls inside serverless functions
