# Display an iframe modal

This sample is designed to help you with opening a popup iframe modal from inside the custom card. You can embed a link of your choice into this iframe. For the sake of simplicity, we have embedded a link to Wikipedia as shown below.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Update your CLI and & authenticate your account

1. Update to latest CLI version by running `npm install -g @hubspot/cli@latest`.
1. Run `hs init` if you haven’t already done so to create a config file for your parent account.
1. Run `hs auth` to authenticate your account. Alternatively, select your pre-authenticated account with `hs accounts use`.

### Step 2: Create the project

In the folder where you want this sample to be cloned, create a new project by running `hs project create --templateSource="HubSpot/ui-extensions-examples" --location="display-iframe-modal" --name="display-iframe-modal" --template="display-iframe-modal"`

### Step 3: Install dependencies

Now in the CLI, enter into this newly created folder by `cd display-iframe-modal`. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies for this project.

### Step 4: Upload project

Run `hs project upload`. If you’d like to build on this project, run `hs project dev` to kickoff the dev process and see changes reflected locally as you build.

### Step 5: View the cards

In the main menu select `Contacts` > `Contacts` to view contact records. Click on any of the contact objects and navigate to the custom tab to access the sample card. If you don’t have any contacts in the account you’re using to view this sample, create a contact by the following steps:

1. In the main menu, select `Contacts` > `Contacts`.
2. Click `Create contact` in the top right hand corner and fill in all required fields. Click `create` once you’ve finished filling in your contact details.
3. Your new contact should appear in the `Contacts table`. Select it and navigate to the `Custom` tab in the middle pane to access the sample card.

If you haven't customized the tabs before follow step #4 from [this guide](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/platform/ui-extensions-quickstart).
